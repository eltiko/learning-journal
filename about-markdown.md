# Computer Architecture and Logic

## How computers work? 

Computers are everywhere now.
we use them everywhere
in our **cars, offices, even on us** (watches, telephones)
## what makes a computer , a computer 

A computer has three activities; enter, process, record and exit.
in fact what emerges is the result of the information given to it.
this is possible thanks to two components; software and hardwares.
The hardwares are cuicuits, plugs speakers .... that you can see inside the machine
Software is against running programs in the machine.
It is possible to install multiple or remove them.
These are *games, browsers and applications.
### note 
It should be noted that hardwares can run more programs simultaneously however this can cause a slowdown.
Moreover, you have to know that the machine is not intelligent, it only obeys precise commands.

# Terminal;
a terminal is a program that emulates a console in a graphical interface, it allows to launch commands. it allows you to directly type a command to execute instead of going through several clicks.
## The Command Line.
the command line depends on the operating system of the computer; windows, mac, linux ...
To open it;
**If** you're on a Mac then you'll find the program Terminal under Applications -> Utilities. An easy way to get to it is the key combination 'command + space' which will bring up Spotlight, then start typing Terminal and it will soon show up.
**If** on Linux then you will probably find it in Applications -> System or Applications -> Utilities. Alternatively you may be able to 'right-click' on the desktop and there may be an option 'Open in terminal'.
**If** you are on Windows and intend to remotely log into another machine then you will need an SSH client
## Basic Navigation;
there are several basic commands;
**pwd** : Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently.
**ls** : List the contents of a directory.
**CD** : Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.

## About Files:
With the terminal the files appear without extension
but the indexes identify them
by example;
**file.exe** - an executable file, or program.
**file.txt** - a plain text file.
**file.png, file.gif, file.jpg** - an image.
